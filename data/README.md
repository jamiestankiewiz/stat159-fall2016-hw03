The data/folder contains 4 documents: Advertising.csv, eda-output.txt, regression.RData, correlation-matrix.RData

Advertising.csv is from "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" (by James et al). This is the data set that we will use in this project/hw.
  You can read this in excel.

regression.RData and correlation-matrix.RData contain outputs produced in my ../code/scripts/ directory.  
You can load this data into R by the function: 'load("data/regression.RData")' in R.



You can look at what is produced by typing in the code: "eda-output.txt" in gitbash or shell.
