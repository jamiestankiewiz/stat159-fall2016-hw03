This repository contains the hw03 for the fall 2016, Stat159 at UC Berkeley.

This project is about generating data for a multiple linear regression model in R.

We will be looking at the advertising.csv data set that can be found in the data/ folder.


Data, charts, plots and model are all based off of the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" (by James et al).


In this repository, I have 4 directories: data, code, images, and report

The data/ directory is where I stored my data such as the data sheet and coding outputs and environment (.RData files).  
The code/ directory is where I stored my code in R.  Including R code, functions made in R, and tests.  
The images/ directory contains all of the graphics and tables in the report.  These can also be found in the book book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" (by James et al).  
The report/ directory contains my report.Rmd and the report.pdf

The code can be generated through Makefile in gitbash.
